# HackerRank Orchestrate

Starter repository for the **HackerRank Orchestrate** 24-hour hackathon (September 2026).

## Buy or Wait?

Build an AI-powered financial agent that decides whether a user can safely afford a requested expense.

A user may ask: **"Can I afford this laptop?"**

Answering well takes more than the current balance. The agent must account for recurring expenses, pending payments, essential spending, confirmed income, available payment options, and relevant details buried in messages and images.

For every request, the agent decides whether the user should pay in full, pay partially, use installments, wait, or not proceed. The recommendation must be personalized: two users with the same balance can deserve different answers based on their commitments, priorities, payment preferences, and willingness to adjust flexible expenses.

A recommendation is safe only if the user can complete the full payment plan, cover essential expenses, and stay above their preferred minimum balance throughout the forecast period.

## Architecture Highlights

- **State Machine Core**: Deterministic rules engine, not stochastic LLM routing, for balance-safety decisions, cash-flow simulations, and candidate plan ranking. LLM calls are restricted solely to upstream perception (image extraction), guaranteeing that all financial math, constraint enforcement, and affordability statuses remain 100% reproducible and mathematically sound.
- **Ledger Arithmetic**: Core cash flow ledger simulation (`CashFlowSimulator.simulate_daily_balances`) calculates daily account balance trajectories strictly using Python's `decimal.Decimal` quantized to 2 decimal places (`Decimal("0.01")`) with `ROUND_HALF_UP` rounding. Currency conversions and fee calculations in `Reconciler` similarly utilize `Decimal` rounded to 2 decimal places with `ROUND_HALF_UP`. Quantized amounts are converted to `float` for serializing to output schema representations.
- **Multimodal Perception**: Receipt and invoice extraction from images in `evidence_extractor.py` is powered by Google's `gemini-2.5-flash` model. Extractions are validated against a strict Pydantic model (`ReceiptExtraction`) and backed by a persistent disk cache (`dataset/cache/image_extractions.json`), enabling the complete evaluation pipeline to execute with 0 live API calls and 0 token cost.
- **6-Tier Tie-Break**: Candidate plan selection follows an exact 6-tier tuple sort key (`(completion <= desired, spending_changes == 'none', total_payable_amount, first_payment_date, number_of_payments, payment_option_id)`) unit-tested against constructed edge cases across every tier in `tests/test_phase5_selector.py` (not formally verified).

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and move into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/interviewstreet/hackerrank-orchestrate-september26.git
cd hackerrank-orchestrate-september26
```

Build your solution in `code/main.py`, or use another language and document its entry point clearly.

Your solution must:

- Read the input files from `dataset/`
- Generate one prediction for every request
- Write the final predictions to `output.csv` in the repository root

Run the starter Python entry point with:

```bash
python3 code/main.py
```

After running your solution, confirm that `output.csv` exists in the repository root and contains the required columns and one row for every request.

## Important File Locations

```text
dataset/        Input data and the blank output template. Do not modify the input data.
code/           Your solution code.
output.csv      Final generated predictions in the repository root.
code.zip        ZIP file containing your complete solution for submission.
```

The blank template at `dataset/output.csv` is provided as a reference. Your final generated file must be the root-level `output.csv`.

Only `dataset/requests.csv` requires predictions. Everything else is context. Join user records with `user_id`, request records with `request_id`, supporting evidence with `related_event_id`, and exchange rates with the rate date and currency pair.

Amounts are in the user's `home_currency` — the dataset uses INR, ZAR, IDR, USD, and EUR, and every conversion rate you need is in `exchange_rates.csv`. All dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`. Live exchange rates, market data, and banking access are not required.

## What You Need to Build

For every row in `dataset/requests.csv`, produce one row in `output.csv` with:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `request_id` | The request being answered |
| `amount_safe_to_pay` | Largest amount safe to pay on `request_date` before optional spending changes, after protecting essentials and the minimum balance |
| `affordability_status` | `affordable_now`, `affordable_with_plan`, `affordable_later`, or `not_affordable` |
| `recommended_payment_method` | `full_payment`, `partial_payment`, `installments`, `wait`, or `not_recommended` |
| `payment_plan` | Chronological `<YYYY-MM-DD>:<amount>` entries joined by `\|`, or `none` |
| `earliest_date_for_full_payment` | Earliest date the full amount is forecast safe as one payment; empty if never within the forecast |
| `spending_changes_needed` | Up to three `stop:<event_id>` / `reduce_to:<event_id>:<amount>` changes joined by `\|`, or `none` |
| `decision_explanation` | Short explanation and the financial facts behind it |

`0 <= amount_safe_to_pay <= requested_amount` must always hold. Installment plans must exactly match a supplied payment option, and only recurring expenses marked flexible may be changed.

`affordable_with_plan` means the full request is completed through a partial-payment schedule, installments, or permitted spending changes. Recommend `partial_payment` only when the request allows it, the user accepts it, `0 < amount_safe_to_pay < requested_amount`, and `earliest_date_for_full_payment` is on or before `desired_completion_date`. Use exactly two payments: pay `amount_safe_to_pay` on `request_date`, then pay the remaining amount on `earliest_date_for_full_payment`. The two payments must add up to `requested_amount`. Unlike installments, partial payment does not need to match a supplied payment option.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Inspect `dataset/sample_requests.csv` — 25 requests with completed output columns — to understand the expected format and decision style.
2. Reconstruct each user's financial state from `financial_profiles.csv` and `financial_events.csv`: separate recurring expenses from one-time events, reserve pending transactions, count confirmed salary only on its settlement date, and de-duplicate repeated representations of the same event.
3. When an event has a blank `amount`, find its `event_id` as `related_event_id` in `images.csv` and extract the amount from the linked image. Never treat a blank amount as zero. Pull in any other relevant messages, images, and payment options for the request.
4. Forecast forward and generate a plan that keeps the balance above the minimum at every step.
5. Verify deterministically — bounds, plan feasibility, schedule match, flexible-only spending changes — before writing `output.csv`.
6. Score yourself on the solved samples, then run the full dataset.

You may use any language or runtime. Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript are all reasonable choices.

## Known Ambiguities & Design Decisions

### 90-Day Cash Flow Projection Policy
The 90-day balance forecast requires deciding how aggressively to project recurring income and expenses forward when they are only evidenced by transaction history rather than explicitly scheduled in future rows.

- **Implemented Policy**:
  - **Recurring Expenses**: Historical expenses occurring within a 45-day lookback window that are marked as recurring (or belong to structural recurring categories such as rent, utilities, subscriptions) are deduplicated by commitment key `(category, description, direction)` and projected forward on their monthly day-of-month across the 90-day window (`[request_date, request_date + 90 days]`), skipping any date slot where an explicit future transaction already exists.
  - **Recurring Income (Salary)**: Future scheduled/settled salaries take precedence. When relying on historical salary, only regular base salary with stable descriptions and amounts is projected forward. Variable, volatile, or irregular earnings—including bonuses, commissions, arrears, overtime, severance/final settlements, gig/shift pay, and unapproved prize/windfall inflows—are treated as unconfirmed and excluded from forward projections (matching the dataset's base-salary-vs-commission pattern). Furthermore, if message evidence indicates employment termination or seasonal contract expiration, future recurring salary projections are cancelled entirely.
- **Specification Basis**:
  This conservative projection policy is directly grounded in `problem_statement.md`'s explicit requirements:
  - Line 7: *"account for recurring expenses, pending payments, essential spending, confirmed income..."*
  - Line 36: *"Historical and pending transactions, non-cash investment values, and the next confirmed salary."*
  - Lines 176–180 (§90-Day Safety Check): *"Forecast the user's balance for the next 90 days using recurring income and expenses, confirmed future payments... A plan is safe only if the balance never falls below `minimum_balance_to_keep`. Ignore pending credits, failed or cancelled transactions, duplicate records, and unrealized investments."*
  - Line 207: *"Do not invent unsupported income, expenses, payment options, or financial information."*
  
  Note: This policy cites `problem_statement.md`, not `AGENTS.md`, which defines coding-agent operational guardrails and output schema contracts but does not address forecasting policy.

## Requirements

Your solution must:

- be runnable from the terminal
- read the provided files from `dataset/`
- produce a valid `output.csv` with the exact required columns in the exact required order
- include one prediction for every `request_id` in `dataset/requests.csv`
- not use organizer-only files or hardcoded labels
- keep behavior deterministic where possible

If you use API keys or secrets, read them from environment variables. Never hardcode secrets in the repo.

---

## Evaluation

Your `output.csv` will be compared against hidden ground-truth values.

The scoring will consider:

- accuracy of `amount_safe_to_pay`
- correctness of `affordability_status`
- correctness of `recommended_payment_method` and `payment_plan`
- accuracy of `earliest_date_for_full_payment`
- validity of `spending_changes_needed`
- usefulness and consistency of `decision_explanation`

### Token Usage And Cost Analysis

Your `code.zip` must include one token-usage file:

```text
evaluation/usage_report.md
```

The report must cover model providers and names, model calls, input and output tokens, total and average tokens per request, estimated total and per-request cost. The reported values must correspond to the final full-dataset run that produced your `output.csv`.

## Chat Transcript Logging

This repo includes an [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) file for AI coding tools. It asks compatible tools to append conversation summaries to a `log.txt` in the repository root — the same directory as `AGENTS.md`:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `<repo root>/log.txt` |
| Windows | `<repo root>\log.txt` |

The path resolves relative to `AGENTS.md`, so it stays correct across clones, renames, and checkouts. `log.txt` is gitignored — upload it as your chat transcript at submission time. Do not paste secrets into the chat.

In case, the harness you are using is not in the repo root, you can explicitly ask the agent to look for the AGENTS.md in this folder & then continue.
